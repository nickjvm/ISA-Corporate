Welcome to YUI.

The YUI Library is a set of utilities and controls, written in JavaScript,
for building richly interactive web applications using techniques such 
as DOM scripting, DHTML and AJAX. YUI is available under a BSD license 
and is free for all uses.

The source tree for YUI includes the following directories:

* api: Generated API docs for the entire library in HTML format.  These
     documents are build using YUI Doc from the contents of the src
     directory.
* build: Generated/built YUI files.  The built files are generated from 
     the contents of the src directory.  Files are provided in full,
     commented form (suitable for debugging) and in minified form 
     (suitable for deployment and use).
* sandbox: The sandbox directory contains works-in-progress, including
     unreleased future components, as well as experimental and/or
     demonstration code created by library authors.
* src: This directory contains the source code (JavaScript, CSS, image
     assets, ActionScript files) for the library. src also contains (or
     will contain) all module documentation, tests and examples. The 
     src/common directory contains documentation, tests and examples 
     that are not for a specific YUI component. All modifications to 
     the library and its documentation should take place in this 
     directory.  (You will find in the src directory files like 
     build.xml that are used in the build process.  We have not
     yet released the build tool that builds components or the build
     tool that builds the library generally; we are working on
     documenting those tools for public use and they will appear on
     GitHub shortly.

Code found in the development head is always a work in progress and
should be treated as experimental.
